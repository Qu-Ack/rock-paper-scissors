# rock-paper-scissors

Good Morning! 

I will try to make this project as creative as possible. Although the game rock paper scissorcs currently will only be playable in the console. I will still code a front end for the future. 

The idea for the front end is to make a neon theme based website. the color scheme would be pink and black.

The back end would ofcourse be coded in javascript and as I said earlier the game would only be playable in the console but we will definitely make a UI in the future.
